- Total Rides

    As noted above, the Urban city type has the most amount of rides in this dataset. Urban cities combined provided nearly 3 times the amount of rides compared to Suburban cities and 13 times more rides than Rural cities.

    This is logical data, considering population size of rural, suburban and urban city types.

- Total Drivers
    
    There are fewer total drivers in Suburban and Rural areas compared to the number of rides. 

    There are more drivers than rides in Urban cities suggesting that there are more part time drivers, and some drivers did not actually provide any rides in this data set.

- Total Fares
    Urban cities have generated the most revenue, bringing in nearly $40K in fares. Suburban cities ranked second in revenue at almost $20K and Rural cities brought in nearly $5K of revenue.

- Average fare per ride
    Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride, suggesting that urban travellers are going shorter distances. 
    Suburban cities have the second average fare per ride, which is logical as some Suburban dwellers will work in the Urban cities.

- Average fare per driver
    Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver of the three 
- Total fare by city type
